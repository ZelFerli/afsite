      <div class="space-y-6 text-muted leading-relaxed">

        <p>
          My professional name is <strong class="text-ink">Ana Ferli</strong>.
          My full legal name is <strong class="text-ink">Željana Marić Ferli</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have worked internationally since <strong class="text-ink">2010</strong>,
          primarily in education and language-focused roles. Over the years, I’ve lived
          and worked across different countries and cultural contexts, which shaped how
          I think about communication, learning, and audience needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          My background as a global educator strongly influences my work in marketing
          and analytics. Teaching across cultures requires clarity, adaptability, and
          attention to how information is received — skills that translate directly into
          content work, reporting, and data interpretation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Much of my recent professional experience has been freelance and contract-based.
          This work was often steady and practical rather than flashy: maintaining content,
          supporting ongoing campaigns, updating reports, cleaning data, and helping teams
          keep information organized and usable over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m a continuous learner by nature. I tend to move between disciplines — education,
          marketing, analytics, information design — and I’m most comfortable working at
          intersections rather than inside rigid categories. That curiosity is what keeps
          the work interesting and sustainable for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          When it comes to data, I’m particularly interested in visualization as a way of
          thinking. Turning raw or messy data into charts and dashboards forces decisions
          about structure, emphasis, and what actually matters. I aim to design visualizations
          that reduce cognitive load and make patterns easier to notice and discuss.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work, I’m drawn to music and literature, especially science fiction.
          I’m interested in how speculative ideas, systems, and alternative futures are
          constructed — a curiosity that quietly mirrors how I approach real-world data
          and information.
